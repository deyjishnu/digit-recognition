%% ================= Implement Predict for Training Set =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.

% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('MNISTDataset');
load('MNISTDataset');
X = trainingImages((1:60000),:);
y = trainingLabels((1:60000),:);
m = size(X, 1);
load('neuralNetworkWeights.mat');

% Randomly select 100 data points to display
sel = randperm(size(X, 1));
sel = sel(1:100);

displayData(X(sel, :));

fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;
pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);

fprintf('\nTraining Set Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(pred == y)) * 100);
fprintf('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
pause;

%% =========== Part 2: Predicting training images =============
%  To give you an idea of the network's output, you can also run
%  through the examples one at the a time to see what it is predicting.

%  Randomly permute examples
rp = randperm(m);

for i = 1:m
    % Display 
    fprintf('\nDisplaying Example Image\n');
    displayData(X(rp(i), :));

    pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X(rp(i),:));
    fprintf('\nNeural Network Prediction: %d (digit %d)\n', pred, mod(pred, 10));
    
    % Pause with quit option
    s = input('Paused - press enter to continue, q to exit:','s');
    if s == 'q'
      break
    end
end
